# WWDC 2019

**[Keynote](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/101)**

Started off boring then BAM! SwiftUI is announced in the final minutes. Tim Cook is off key, sounds more like a product launch than a developer conference. Where's Phil?

**[Platforms State of the Union](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/103)**

The first two sections are interesting, the third not so much. Lots of fun new stuff.


**[What's New in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/402)**

Really interesting. It highlights the foresite and skill Apple has driven their course towards it's latest technologies. So many of the new API play an intregal part of SwiftUI. Covers: **@propertywrapper**, default values for init(), new keyword `some`, and how the editor allows **DSLs** (Domain Specific Languages).


**[Introducing SwiftUI: Building Your First App](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/204)**

Wow, we're watching our future. Facinating. Bummed it only available for iOS 13 and beyond. View composition is explored.

**[Advances in UI Data Sources](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/220)**

Another interesting session discussing data binding and a single source of truth for models. Includes discussion on new table and collection view data API and how they use a diff of model and the current state to brodcast data changes.

**[SwiftUI Essentials](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/216)**

Works on Avocado Toast app to demonstrate Views. Key take away SwiftUI is designed to use small views with composition. Views are structs that conform to the View protocol. Lots of repeated info from previous sessions. Another SwiftUI doctrine is “learn once, use anywhere”.
