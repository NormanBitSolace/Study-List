# Study List

### WWDC 2019

**[Keynote](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/101)**

Started off boring then BAM! SwiftUI is announced in the final minutes. Tim Cook is off key, sounds more like a product launch that a developer conference. Where's Phil?

**[Platforms State of the Union](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/103)**

The first two sections are interesting, the third not so much. Lots of fun new stuff.


**[What's New in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/402)**

Really interesting. It highlights the foresite and skill Apple has driven their course towards it's latest technologies. So many of the new API play an intregal part of SwiftUI.


**[Introducing SwiftUI: Building Your First App](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/204)**

Wow, we're watching our future. Facinating. Bummed it only available for iOS 13 and beyond. View composition is explored.

**[Advances in UI Data Sources](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/220)**

Another interesting session discussing data binding and a single source of truth for models. Includes discussion on new table and collection view data API and how they use a diff of model and the current state to brodcast data changes.


### May 2019

#### Coordinators

1. **[MVVM+FlowController](http://merowing.info/2016/01/improve-your-ios-architecture-with-flowcontrollers)**
1. **[Navigation in Swift](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/navigation-in-swift?rq=coordinator)**
1. **[How to use the coordinator pattern](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps)**
1. **[Advanced coordinators in iOS](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/175/advanced-coordinator-pattern-tutorial-ios)**
1. **[Coordinators Redux](http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/)**

Interesting examinations of the benefits of using an app coordinator to handle navigation flow and thus lesson what view controllers are responsible for. Soroush's article was years before the others and I suspect impacted the adoption of coordinators. After reading his article years ago I recall contacting him with questions and his response being quite friendly.

### April 2019

**[Source Control Workflows in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/418/)**

Rudimentary overview of source control in Xcode.


### March 2019

**[Super-powered string interpolation in Swift 5.0 by Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/178/super-powered-string-interpolation-in-swift-5-0)**

Interesting look at Swift 5's string interpolation that includes lots of examples.
***
**[Swift Talk - String Interpolation](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E144-string-interpolation-in-swift-5-part-2)**

The string interpolation lesson was presented in the context of a project they're working on and it got lost in the projects details rather than the intended message.
***
**[Solving the binding problem with Swift by Srđan Rašić](http://five.agency/solving-the-binding-problem-with-swift/)**

Excellent look at how and why to implement data binding with Swift and reasons to consider an Rx solution.
***
**[How not to get desperate with MVVM implementation by S.T.Huang](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/how-to-use-a-model-view-viewmodel-architecture-for-ios-46963c67be1b)**

Very interesting. Talks about MVVM providing a cleaner architecture.
***
**[Method Dispatch in Swift by Brian King](https://www.raizlabs.com/dev/2016/12/swift-method-dispatch/)**

Excellent deep dive into how Swift types virtual tables work. Read several times and still need to read again.
***
**WWDC 2016 [Understanding Swift Performance](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/416/)**
> This is the best discussion on Swift dispatch I've come across. Watch multiple times, new things to learn each time. I haven't figured out how to incorate knowledge about Existential Containers, Protocol Witness Tables, or Value Witness Tables but this video sure gives an appreciation for the deep thought behind Swift's implementation.
***
**Dave Abraham's [Protocol-Oriented Programming in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/)**
> The best Swift goody ever. A new way of thinking. Changed the way I see Swift and coding. Crusty!
***
**[Embracing Algorithms](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/223/)**
> Dave Abrahams, Swift Standard Library lead, talks about the power of being able to extend protocols. He demonstrates how this new feature (at the time) significantly reduced comlexity, clutter, auto generated code, etc.
